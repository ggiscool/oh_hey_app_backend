### Overview
  Have you ever needed help starting conversations at office get togethers? Ever came on too strong via dating app chat that you blew the opportunity for a date? Well, look for you solution no further. Chatter up provides you with all the conversation starters you need. Simply choose a topic, click the button, and a conversation starter pops up in the topic of your choice.

### Deployment
  Heroku is a cloud platform as a service that we used as our web application deployment model. To view live, visit XXXXXXXXXXX.

### Approach
  I used mainly Javascript and Ruby on Rails to make a single-page web application. I wanted to make a fun app that was also practical, simple, and easy to use.

### Technical Difficulties
  We had a good deal of trouble perfecting the authentication process, deploying to Heroku, allowing users to upvote an answer only once, and keeping the site one page. We worked through all issues as a team and triumphed over adversity.

### Future Implementations
  In the future, I would like to be able to have a question/fact submission functionality, where they can be approved before posting.

### Tech Used
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js, JSON Postgres, Ruby and Rails.
  - Gems:ruby, rails, pg, puma, bcrypt, jwt, dotenv-rails, bootsnap, rack-cors, byebug, awesome_print, listen, spring, spring-watcher-listen.
  - Atom for text-editing.
  - Postman for testing.
